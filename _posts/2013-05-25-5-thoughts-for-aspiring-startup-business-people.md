I know that everybody and their dog has written a "10 small business tips" or "Be the next bazillion-dollar company guy in 3 easy steps!" blog posts, but in today's post, I will shamelessly assert that _my_ cool-awesome blog post about the same thing is way better.

After reading this post, I will have you thinking, "Wow, that _was_ 5 things!".

### 1. Jump in feet first

Do yourself a favor and stop reading about business so much. Not only is reading for squares, but you will get so much more out of hands-on experience. 

### 2. Find a niche

It's pretty simple - the hotter the market space, the more competition you have.

So find something seemingly cold, a niche market, and then test the waters. It might be warmer than you think. Or maybe that's just where you're standingâ€¦ gross.

### 3. Have goals

It's _insanely_ tempting the just start building stuff, especially if you are starting a technical company (where the startup costs are low).

This is bad, because you blaze an ambling trail that has no end. You will continue to aim for perfection and (naturally) never achieve it. Set specific, measurable milestones and hold yourself to them.

### 4. Meet people

Go networking. Talk to random people. If you are a natural introvert, much like myself, and you are having _fun_ at a networking event, you're doing it wrong.

But not only will it give you more confidence in your life, it will make you a better salesperson. It will help you pitch your idea and convey your value to real people. Plus you will gain raw insights about your business from people that aren't your friends.

### 5. Last but most important: creativity is a skill

Trying to create stuff can be a real drag when you suck at it.

But it's not just you! Everybody sucks at first. You just need to beef up your creative-y brain muscles.

In a surprisingly counter-intuitive turn of events, creativity often boils down to process. Inspiration helps, but to execute on that inspiration, and really make something beautiful, you will need control of that creative energy.
