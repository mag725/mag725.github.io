Too often do I get emails soliciting help with "my cool-awesome app-tacular".

With all the buzz around mobile it's easy to see why having your own app (whatever *that* means), comes accross as the silver bullet of marketing, user acquisition, distribution, etc.

But having an app will not breathe life to your dreams of becoming a cool internet business guy. 

There never is, and never has been any value in software. Much like the written word, I could slap some words on the page, call it a vampire love story and nobody would read that crap (right? ... *right?*) - in other words, there is no *intrinsic* value in the written word itself. The meaning is found *between the lines*.

Your app is nothing more than a *delivery mechanism for an experience*.

###Considerations when creating an experience

####1. Content-driven apps
In many (I would say most) cases, the experience comes from some content (see Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Your content-driven app may have a kickass, gorgeous design, but why do I care if your content sucks?

####2. Importance of design
I do not mean to downplay the *critical* nature of having a great app design. The ubiquitous, open nature of the content in our lives today means that users have *choices*. Many apps hook into our social lives to display pre-existing content in new, innovative ways. 

Design is a key differentiator between your app everybody elses. People have come to expect the utmost awesomeness out of the apps they use, and you need to deliver.

####3. Proprietary content
Now, some apps seem to survive on a terrible design, but it usually means they have proprietary, *relevant* content (see Craigslist). Acquiring such content can be extremely difficult and time-consuming, so just keep that in mind.

####4. Design-driven apps
Some apps successfully rely *solely* on their design to deliver the experience. I use a text editor called *SublimeText* which has a mode that removes all menus, buttons, etc. from view - it's called "Distraction Free Mode", and it *feels great*. I get chills staring at a blank page in Distraction Free Mode. It's fantastic.
