		<p>Too often do I get emails soliciting help with &#8220;my cool-awesome app-tacular&#8221;.</p>

<p>With all the buzz around mobile it&#8217;s easy to see why having your own app (whatever <em>that</em> means), comes accross as the silver bullet of marketing, user acquisition, distribution, etc.</p>

<p>But having an app will not breathe life to your dreams of becoming a cool internet business guy.</p>

<p>There never is, and never has been any value in software. Much like the written word, I could slap some words on the page, call it a vampire love story and nobody would read that crap (right? &#8230; <em>right?</em>) - in other words, there is no <em>intrinsic</em> value in the written word itself. The meaning is found <em>between the lines</em>.</p>

<p>Your app is nothing more than a <em>delivery mechanism for an experience</em>.</p>

<h3 id='considerations_when_creating_an_experience'>Considerations when creating an experience</h3>

<h4 id='1_contentdriven_apps'>1. Content-driven apps</h4>

<p>In many (I would say most) cases, the experience comes from some content (see Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Your content-driven app may have a kickass, gorgeous design, but why do I care if your content sucks?</p>

<h4 id='2_importance_of_design'>2. Importance of design</h4>

<p>I do not mean to downplay the <em>critical</em> nature of having a great app design. The ubiquitous, open nature of the content in our lives today means that users have <em>choices</em>. Many apps hook into our social lives to display pre-existing content in new, innovative ways.</p>

<p>Design is a key differentiator between your app everybody elses. People have come to expect the utmost awesomeness out of the apps they use, and you need to deliver.</p>

<h4 id='3_proprietary_content'>3. Proprietary content</h4>

<p>Now, some apps seem to survive on a terrible design, but it usually means they have proprietary, <em>relevant</em> content (see Craigslist). Acquiring such content can be extremely difficult and time-consuming, so just keep that in mind.</p>

<h4 id='4_designdriven_apps'>4. Design-driven apps</h4>

<p>Some apps successfully rely <em>solely</em> on their design to deliver the experience. I use a text editor called <em>SublimeText</em> which has a mode that removes all menus, buttons, etc. from view - it&#8217;s called &#8220;Distraction Free Mode&#8221;, and it <em>feels great</em>. I get chills staring at a blank page in Distraction Free Mode. It&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
